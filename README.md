# Interactive_balls

Project for CSCI:2340 Software Engineering

## Description
An interactive ball game intended to run while a program is being compiled

For the purpose of experimenting and learning about the software development process. Will be developed and improved upon given
more user requirements and specifications.

UPDATE: The balls are now representative of OS metrics, specifically CPU and Network usage. The ball's radius is determined by the
CPU usage and the ball's velocity is determined by the Network usage.
